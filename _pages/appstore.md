Introduction
------------

With the initial launch of iPhone App store on July 10, 2008, the mobile games industry has grown to worth billions of dollars over the years, with companies spending vast amounts of money on the development and marketing of these games. Some mobile games, such as Clash of Clans and Pokemon Go, have become an international success, accumulating over hundred millions of users, proving just how attractive and accessible mobile games are to people with smart devices. Even the most popular veteran console game developers, such as Nintendo, have release free mobile games, extending their franchise into the mobile games industry.

The Apple Appstore Mobile Games dataset was found on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) and it contains Airbnb listings of New York City with 48895 observations and 16
variables such as price, neighbourhood, room type, minimum nights, reviews per month and last review date.

Abstract
--------
This explanatory data analysis will focus on univariate/bivariate analysis through visualization to uncover some trends within the New York Cityâ€™s Airbnb market. The first part of the analysis will focus on the price distribution amongst different levels of other variables such as neighbourhood group, neighbourhoods within each group, room type and others. Next, we will use reviews per month metric to see which listings are more popular than others. This exploratory data analysis was performed on R and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/junsu-ku/NYC-Airbnb-EDA-in-R).
