I'm a recent graduate at University of Waterloo, Bachelor of Mathematics with
major in Statistics.

I started data analytics using R as my first tool, as R has very useful packages for data-related work, such as dplyr and ggplot2.
Also, I tend to find R's syntax very logical and easy to understand, so you will notice that I tend to rely on R when working on my personal projects.
Other languages I have expertise in are python, sql and git.

My interests in data analytics focus on Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Visualization and Predictive Modeling.

I am currently looking for an entry-level data analytics position in Toronto, ON.

If you are interested in interviewing me for a possible open positions, please send me an [email](mailto:ku.junsu@gmail.com) or a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junsu-ku/)!

Thank you!
