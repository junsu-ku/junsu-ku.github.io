My name is June JunSu Ku and I am a recent graduate at University of Waterloo, Bachelor of Mathematics with
major in Statistics.

My data analysis experience began with statistical computing in __*R*__. I am very familiar with R Studio and data handling packages such as __*dplyr, ggplot2, plotly*__ and __*car*__. I am also experienced with building interactive applications with __*R Shiny*__ to visualize and communicate data.

My interest in data analysis focuses on __*Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Visualization*__ and __*Predictive Modeling*__.

I am currently looking for opportunities to apply data analysis in real-time data with real business impact.

Thank you!
