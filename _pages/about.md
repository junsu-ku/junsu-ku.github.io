My name is June JunSu Ku and I am a recent graduate at University of Waterloo, Bachelor of Mathematics with
major in Statistics.

My data analysis experience began with statistical computing in *R*. I am very familiar with R Studio and data handling packages such as *dplyr, ggplot2* and *car*. I am also experienced with building interactive applications with *R Shiny* to visualize and communicate data.

My interest in data analysis focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Visualization and Predictive Modeling.

I am currently looking for opportunities to apply data analysis in real-time data with real business impact. 

Thank you!
