Introduction
------------

<br/>

Airbnb is an online platform for arranging lodging,
homestays or tourism experiences. Acting as an online broker, Airbnb
allows hosts to offer their real estate listings on their platform and
users can easily book their stay for their next travel destinations.

<br/>

The New York City Airbnb dataset was found on
[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
and it contains Airbnb listings of New York City with 48895 observations and 16
variables such as price, neighbourhood, room type, minimum nights, reviews per
month and last review date.

Abstract
--------
This explanatory data analysis will focus on univariate/bivariate analysis through visualization to uncover some trends within the New York Cityâ€™s Airbnb market. The first part of the analysis will focus on the price distribution amongst different levels of other variables such as neighbourhood group, neighbourhoods within each group, room type and others. Next, we will use reviews per month metric to see which listings are more popular than others. This exploratory data analysis was performed on R and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/junsu-ku/NYC-Airbnb-EDA-in-R).
